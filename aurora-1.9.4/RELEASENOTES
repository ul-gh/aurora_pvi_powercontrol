NOTE!! I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM CENTRAL OR TRIO OWNERS IF THE OPTIONS INCLUDED
       HEREIN WORK OR NOT BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO PURSUE WHAT IS HERE AND MORE.
       --------
       This is kind of some early work to improve 3 phase reporting and
       include reporting for Central ind Trio nverters. There were some issues
       with floating point numbers not being converted correctly but last I 
       heard they were correct without any changes made to aurora so I'm
       skeptical. It is possible it was due to the computer/architecture/OS
       that was being used and not an aurora issue. So PLEASE PLEASE if you
       are using aurora with a 3 phase or Central or Trio inverter and notice
       any anomalies with aurora do let me know.

v1.9.4 - gcc compiler change mandated removing declarations for VersionC and
         VersionSHc from main.c because they're declared in a include file

v1.9.3 - if returning _ERROR_ and verbose print out debug info
       - modified float functions _ERROR_ handling

v1.9.2 - modify Makefile to allow manual disabling of -march compile option
         if necessary to compile for paltforms other then where the compile
         is being done.

v1.9.1 - reduce the time spent sleeping while waiting to get the lock on the 
         serial port. **NOTE** if you are using "-w <num>, --lock-wait=<num>"
         you will need to adjust the value <num>. See the -h help or Man page
         for the updated constraints. A random number at a minimum of 10 to a 
         maximum of 100 checks to lock the port will be done per second for a 
         maximum of 30 seconds.
       - changed two subroutines type to unsigned and their return value
         which indicates an error occured to allow for larger values to be
         returned
 
v1.9.0 - fixed a compile warning and seg fault issue that would occur on some 
         but not all architectures

v1.8.9 - improve device lock file handling mainly with stale lock handling to
         take into account other processes not associated with aurora using 
         the RS-485 port.

v1.8.8 - fixed negative values being reported in verbose mode

v1.8.7 - ** NOTE ** -E, --get-dsp-3phase has changed to -3, --get-dsp-3phase
       - temperatures can be below zero i.e. negative (inverters installed 
         outdoors)
       - NOTE: -e, --get-energy excludes Aurora Central
       - added -O <num>, --central=<num> ** Experimental ** Indicates 
         Aurora Central (Work in process)
       - added -E <num>, --get-energy-central=<num> Get Cumulated Float  
         Energy readings (Central & TRIO only)
       - correct reporting wrong model when -Q is not used
       - updated -v inverter version reporting 
       - update COLUMNS.key file

v1.8.6 - calculate tm_gmtoff if it is not supplied in tm structure - it was
         requested to just #ifdef it out but that could cause the -k, -q, 
         -L, -S, & -t options to set/report dates/times incorrectly.
         make (Makefile) will determine whether to calculate it or use the
         tm structure

v1.8.5 - NOTE: added -Q, --use-qmult option to use inverter specific 
         Multiplier (if known) for -q, --energy-sent. These Multiplers were 
         were added in version 1.7.8 and used by defualt. These Multipliers 
         are no longer used by default so this option must be used if you
         want the Multiplier used. This Multiplier adjusts the values 
         reported by -q, --energy-sent.
       - added -K, --use-kmult option to adjust vaules reported by -k, 
         --daily-kwh by value supplied with option. Seems how the data is
         being stored may be different on different inverter models

v1.8.3 - make sure errno is initialized
       - set the mask on the binary on make

v1.8.0 - minor changes to help and man page
       - initialize some variables so as to avoid compiler warnings
       - check validity of time value returned by query to inverter to
         get its time
       - allow display of out of order dates for -k (--daily-kwh) if they 
         appear to be valid this may then require the output be sorted
       - handle out of order dates for -k (--daily-kwh) by sorting them 
         and suppressing duplicate entries for a date

v1.7.9 - modify -i, --get-count option to accept a bitmask indicating 
         which couters should be displayed and whether or not the Partial
         Energy counter should be reset to zero

v1.7.8 - README updated
       - changed --delay to --read-wait as the long option for -l so as to 
         better reflect it's function
       - --daily-kwh date started tomorrow instead of today, adjusted 
         timebase
       - dynamically adjust timebase for --daily-kwh if it looks to be off
       - watch for out of order or duplicate dates in --daily-kwh
       - be more aggressive and at the same time patient trying to read 
         characters from slow to respond inverters (READ! the README for
         the impacts this has)
       - added -M option maximum amount of time in seconds that aurora 
         will run
       - updated list of models
       - use multiplier for --energy-sent if known for inverter model
       - revamp --daily-kwh after discovering data may not always be
         contiguous

v1.7.7 - add bad return code tracking to identify operation
       - fix W not kW in all spots for --energy-sent. My bad.
       - timing issues again setting the inverter time waiting for
         inverter response. See README for more information.

v1.7.6 - --energy-sent values are W not kW Doh!
       - Grid Current & Grid Power can now return negative values. This
         occurs when the PV panels are not providing enough power to 
         run the inverter so it sucks some power from the Grid

v1.7.5 - fix man page for -W
       - fixed some bad trailing characters showing up in date strings
         on MIPS platforms
       - -k will now also output to stdout when -b is used not just to 
         stderr. This was by design while -k was considered experimental

v1.7.4 - if a bad return code is returned from any function display a 
         message to STDERR before exiting (used to just exit silently)
       - added -W option to swap endian for ARM and MIPS architectures
       - fixed -k, -n, & -p strings output that were overflowing on occasion
       - make sure the value passed to the -d option is numeric
       - removed ** Experimental ** status from -k, --daily-kwh see the 
         README for more information
       - tweaked the new -q, --energy-sent option, make sure the last data 
         value is reported when starting in the middle of a WORD value 
         pair and had the same strings output issue as -k, -n, & -p on 
         MIPS architectures
       - fixed a malloc corruption when trying to open the lock file

v1.7.3 - changed permissions on the aurora executable to 4711 for none
         root users to be able to run aurora. Had it set to 4755 
         orginally but pulled it back to 4750, needs to be at least 4711.
       - added -L --adjust-time option. See the README for information 
         regarding this option

v1.7.2 - added -q --energy-sent option, see the README for important
         information regarding this option
       - remove size restriction on monetary identifier of the -C option
       - changed permissions on the aurora executable to 4750. This allows
         users other then root to run aurora and not fail due to 
         inaccessibility of the lock file when reading/writing it
       - remove size restriction on various strings
       - checked the TimeBase now that we're back on CST and it checks 
         out correctly. Timezone calculations work. Can remove it from
         the TODO list

v1.7.1 - modify "-d --get-dsp" option. **NOTE** if using "-d" it must be
         changed to "-d 0", if using "--get-dsp" no change is needed
       - modify "-C, --calc-value=<num[:$]>" added "[:$]" to allow monetary
         type to be chosen

v1.7.0 - clean up some compiler warnings for variable set but not used

v1.6.9 - Starting with version 1.6.9 the 'make' tries to determine the gcc 
         'march' & 'mtune' compile flags for optimization
       - corrected joule reading, output conversion error
       - Makefile modifications no longer have to modify the 64bit flag, may
         not have to modify "arch" & "tune" parameters if gcc >= 4.2 on AMD
         & Intel platforms
       - fixed a integer conversion issue for -k due to some architectures
       - fixed bizarreness with -bt
       - adjust TimeBase to true UTC-0000 and take into account timezone in 
         GetTime (-t) and SetTime (-S) functions
       - added 'make check' that reports what the compile will be for
         architecture wise
       - tweaked Makefile to determine "arch" & "tune" using gcc if possible
       - tweaking Makefile for ARM processors
       - tweaked Makefile again for 'make' versions older then 3.82 which
         don't have the 'undefine' directive
       - increase the allowed values from 31 to 63 for inverter address (-a)
         as allowed in newer inverters

v1.6.8 - added -k option to read past days production - this is considered 
         experimental and may or may not work in all instances and especially
         if there is no data for all the days requested - please report any 
         problems/anomalies encountered
       - removed -fpack-struct from the compiler CFLAGS - once again caused 
         longopts not to work
       - added -X option to enable RTS/CTS on the serial port

v1.6.7 - added -A option to read "Last four alarms"
       - fix using wrong param when displaying TransState message
       - pass TransState the command description so if it gets a non-zero 
         status it can report for what command it got it

v1.6.6 - added -P option to throttle commands sent to the inverter

v1.6.2 - added -D & -E to report more DSP information

v1.6.0 - added -U option to delay read after sending command to inverter and
         -u option to report it
       - version numbering now Number dot Number dot Number
       - manpage now included
       - 'make' now has 'install' and 'uninstall' options

v1.5-7 - fix sizeof pointer passing in memset
       - add -Y retries option and -y option to report the number of attempts
         made and use in the Communicate function 
       - in ReadNextChar restore serial port settings and clear lock if exiting

v1.5-5 - added -x option to enable XON/XOFF

v1.5-1 - serial port configuration tweaks

v1.5-0 - Starting with v1.5-0 this work based on Power One's 'Aurora Inverter
         Series - Communication Protocol -' document, Rel. 4.6 25/02/09

v1.4-5 - add -o option to output data to a file

v1.4-4 - don't set lckCNT = -1 when clearing stale serial port lock really
         bonehead move... As Dierks Bentley would say, What was I thinkin'?

v1.4.3 - add cCommandEnd = '\0'

v1.4.2 - disable XON/XOFF flow control on output

v1.3-4 - fix determining if serial port is in use
       - correct szSerBuffer size 

v1.3-3 - correct an error in strftime that only may show up 
         in the first or last week of the year

v1.3-2 - take into account Daylight Savings Time when 
         setting the Aurora's time

v1.3-1 - new release

v1.3-0 - new release

v1.2-9	- fix -n & -p problem that left serial port locked
	- disable all options except -d & -e when -c is used
	- only format time for columns for options -d or -e
	- all verbose output goes to stderr
	- update help

v1.2-5	- add locking of serial port

v1.0-0  -  This work based on Magnetek's 'Aurora PV Inverter - Communications
           Protocol -' document, Rel. 1.8 09/05/2005
