0 - Reporting Bugs

If you run into things that you think might be a bug and 
would like to report it please follow these guidelines to
streamline the process.

If a bad "rc" value in the form of "(-1 nn nn)" is reported
please include it in your message.

If it can be reproduced include the stdout output and the 
verbose stderr output in the following format.

aurora -b <options & device> >option.dat 2>option.err

Example:
aurora -b -a2 -k366 -Y10 /dev/ttyS0 > k.dat 2>k.err

Adding numbers after the (in this case k) if multiple ones 
are sent.

**********************************

I - Intro

If you are using this software to download the data from your
Aurora Inverter and have a public web site showing your data 
send me an email with the URL. I will be creating a web page 
on my Solar Web Site with those links. Tell everyone that you
know about this to do that also.                             
Email Solar at curtronics dot com with your URL.             

If you are using this software to download data from your
Aurora Inverter and are doing so using the USB port on the
inverter I would like to hear from you. I'm particularly 
interested it whether or not you are getting lots of CRC 
errors. I am working with one installation that is constantly
getting CRC errors on a USB connection and has to run the   
program multiple times before it successfully gets the data.
I'd like to determine where the problem is in order to work 
towards eliminating it.                                     
Email Solar at curtronics dot com with your info. Thank you.

II - -k option

The -k option is considered ** Experimental ** because it is
an un-Publicly documented option so it may or may not provide
correct information. It appears the inverter stores the past 
365 days of KWH prodcution data in a block of memory. The 
exact location of that memory block seems to differ in each 
inverter, it may be model related it may not. A pointer is 
available that points to the current days value but no offset
information has been found to indicate at what position in 
the block of memory that is. So the beginning and end of the 
block of memory is not accurately known. aurora attempts to 
watch for the end of the block and then loop back to the 
beginning of the block (round robin storage) to continue 
gathering data. This method works for inverters that have 
366 days (current day included) worth of data but for inveters
that don't the results of the readings are currently unknown.

**********************************

III - Setting the Inverter Time

Setting the time on the inverter using the -S option has been 
known to clear (reset to zero) the energy values reported by 
the -e option (except the Total Energy reported value) and 
also the history reported by the -k option but apparently not 
for the -q option. This is how it behaves on my inveter that 
has a manufacture date of 06 16. However on newer inverters it 
may no longer do this, i.e. zero the data. I know of one inverter 
that has a manufacture date of 10 42 that setting the time via 
the -S option did not clear these data values.

**********************************

IV - Some Known Issues

There have been many reports of communications problems when
using the USB port on Aurora inverters. A work around was added
awhile back, the -Y option to get around this issue. Recently 
someone indicated that there needs to be a minimum of 400 uS  
between the sending of commands to the inverter when          
communicating via the USB port. With this information in hand 
the -P option was added and testing was conducted using the -P
option on inverters that are communicating via the USB port that
exhibit this problem. In some cases it corrected this USB       
problem, in other cases it did not correct the problem and the  
-Y option still had to be used. In short, the -P option will    
cause aurora to not send commands unless the time specified in  
the -P option has elapsed since the last command was sent. So,  
if you are experiencing problems with communicating via the USB 
port try using the -P option starting with a value of 400 and   
increase or decrease the value until reliable communication is  
attained. If that does not eliminate the problem then try using
the -Y option.                                                  

There have been reports saying that Power One is claiming the
USB port is not designed/should not be used for continuous data
gathering/communication. However, this has not been confirmed with
Power One.

Getting more reports from users that Power One is claiming the
USB port is not designed/should not be used for continuous data
gathering/communication. So more users are switching to RS-485 
adapters, that being said it has been reported that using RTS/CTS
control on the serial port when using a RS-485 adapter improves 
the communication reliability. So the -X option has been added to
enable RTS/CTS control on the serial port.

**********************************

V - Operation Tid Bits

If aurora cannot communicate with the Aurora Inverter it dies a
silent death to STDOUT but reports the lack of response to STDERR.
This is on purpose for data collection purposes so you can pipe
the data to a file without having any error messages in the file.
If a CRC error is encountered it will also be reported on STDERR
regardless. If in doubt about what's going on, use the verbose
option to see.

This program has been tested using a standard serial port, i.e.
/dev/ttyS1, and a USB serial port, /dev/ttyUSB0 with equal success.
The USB serial port was the BB DYNEX variety, DX-UBDB9 using the
Prolific Technology, Inc. PL2303 Serial Port. Development and
testing was done on a SuSE Linux 10.0 (custom gen'd kernel)
AMD Sempron 3000 laptop system, for ease of being able to test by
the Aurora Inverter, final destination has it running the data
collection on a SuSE Linux 10.0 (custom kernel) AMD Athlon(tm) XP
3000+ server.

An update to the platform in use, it is now SuSE Linux 11.4 with
their default kernel on a AMD Phenom 1090T with 16G of memory and
a battery backed up caching raid controller.

**********************************

VI - ** NEW -q --energy-sent option **

This was reverse engineered since it is not in the documentation 
that is released to the public. Therefore, it may not work on 
every Aurora inverter. If you suspect it isn't reporting the 
correct data or they are any problems when using it *PLEASE* 
report them so as to help improve this option and aurora on the
whole.

This option will report the amount of energy sent to the grid at
10 second intervals for the past 24 hours. Well that's according 
to the manufacturer. In use it may report more then 24 hours worth
of data, not sure if it will report less then 24 hours so if you 
see that it does please report that fact.

When this option is invoked the timestamp of the reported data may 
look like YYYYMMDD-nnnn instead of 20111106-09:23:14 for example.
Where YYYYMMDD is just that, those characters and not a real date
and time, the nnnn will be an incrementing sequence. This is due to 
not having found a timestamp packet in the data stream as of yet.  
Once a timestamp packet is found the valid date and time for the 
energy values will then be reported.

This is not a problem IMO, the manufacturers Windoze software gets 
the same data they just choose to hide it instead of displaying it. 
In other words, they throw out any data that is received until a
timestamp packet comes their way. This will more then likely always
occur to some degree, the reason being due to how this historical
data is stored in the inverter. At some point in time the timestamp
for the oldest data gets overwritten thus is no longer available.

So why does aurora choose to display it? Well a couple of reasons.
In my experience it can take 10 minutes for this option to run to
completion, it's doing a lot of I/O's to the inverter. If nothing, 
i.e. no output, is displayed during lets say the first 3 minutes, 
some people may think it's not working when it actually is. Second, 
even if the date and time is not known for that data it may be 
possible to sync its date and time using previously recorded data 
for the time period in question.

Once the date and time is displayed if the time looks to be off 
please report that fact. And note, the time displayed is that of 
the time that was on the inverter when it stored the data. So if 
the inverters time is off by 10 minutes, or and hour, that may make 
it look like something is wrong so check the time on the front 
panel on the inverter. The -t option could be used to do that but 
there could be an issue due to timezone settings so the best bet is 
to look at the inverter.

And in the 'It would be nice' department... Before anyone asks, 
having the ability to skip the data that the date and time is not
known for, or picking a starting time, etc., would be nice but... 
Because of how the data is stored it has to be read through in a
serial manner in order to find the date and time for the block of
data following it. There are no entry points except for the 
beginning, there are no offsets or block length values, nothing.
So the data has to be read in a serial manner and as long as it's
being read, it might as well be displayed.

Here is the output in a graphical format:

**********************************

VII - ** NEW -L, --adjust-time **

This option will automatically adjust the inverter's time if it is
found to differ from the computer's time and then only if the 
following constraints are met.

If <num> is >= 1 the inverter's time will only be changed to match
the time on the computer if the inverter's time differs from the 
computer's time by <num> or more seconds.

If <num> is 0 (zero) a Daylight Savings Time check will be done.
This check will only modify the time on the inverter on the day that
any Daylight Savings Time change takes effect and only after it has
taken effect and also only if the time is found to differ by 15 
minutes or more. This check will compare the inverter's current time 
to the computer's current time. If the results of the comparision 
indicate the two times differ by 15 minutes or more and it is on the 
day that a Daylight Savings Time change takes effect, and after it has
taken effect, the inverter's time will be set to match that of the 
computer.

The added 15 minute constraint when doing the Daylight Savings Time 
check is to prevent frivolous changing of the time. The clocks on the 
inverters tend to have a large amount of drift over time. Since the 
change to or from Daylight Savings Time is typically an hour, using a
minimum window of it differing by 15 minutes will help to insure that 
the time is only changed once on that day even if this option is 
continually used throughout the day.

It would be safe to use this option all the time it won't change the 
time unless the constraints are met according to the above. The idea 
is to have it running using the "0" choice on the day that a Daylight 
Savings Time change takes effect. That way first thing in the morning 
once the inverter wakes up its time will be set properly and internal 
history will be recorded with the correct date and time.

***** WARNING ******    ****** WARNING ******    ****** WARNING *****
Setting the Date and Time has been known to clear all History except 
"Total Energy" on some inverters. This is not caused by aurora but
instead is how some inverters are designed to operate. It is suggested 
that the -S option be used to determine if your inverter exhibits this
behavior and if it does and is unacceptable then do not use this option.

**********************************

VIII - removed ** Experimental ** status from -k, --daily-kwh

After further testing I have decided to remove the ** Experimental **
status from this option. One big question in its operation was how it
would handle inverters that had been running for less then a year thus
did not have a full years worth of data to report. Field testing on a
new inverter install has revealed that it operates as designed, as I
had hoped, but as with anything that is reverse engineered one never
knows for sure until it can be tested. But do remember, it was reverse
engineered so if any anomalies are encountered please report them with 
verbose ouput.

**********************************

IX - more on setting Setting the Inverter Time

It has come to my attention that the Set Time function is no longer
documented in the Protocol Documents supplied by Power One, at least
not the two latest ones I have. So it appears they quietly removed 
that function from their documentation, probably instead of making it
work properly, it was easier to just undocument it, but it still works 
and may or may not on all inverters. That being said...

Sometimes when setting the time on the inverter using the -S or -L 
options the inverter may not return the status of that operation in a
timely fashion but the time may still have been set. When this occurs 
you will see the message "no response, comparing time" if you then see 
the message "Inverter date/time set (checked)" the time was successfully 
set within +/- 2 seconds. If you do not see this message the time on the 
inverter is not within 2 seconds of the computer. If you see the message 
"Inverter date/time set (successful)" the inverter did respond and the 
time was successfully set.

As mentioned previously on some inverter models, typically older 
inverters, history data may be cleared (zeroed) for Daily, Weekly, 
Monthly, and Yearly Energy and for --daily-kwh (-k) history, but
not for Total Energy and apparently not for --energy-sent (-q) history
either.

**********************************

X - reading from inverter more aggresively and patiently

How aurora reads responses from the inverter has changed but it's a
double edged sword. It will try harder to get each character from the
inverter at the cost of taking a lot more time to do so. This may
improve USB communications to the inverter.

It will wait up to the value supplied with the -R (--read-timeout) or -l 
(--read-wait) option per character or the sum of both if both are used. 
Since all repsonses are 8 characters if -R 5000 (5 seconds) is used that 
could make the time it takes to read the response approach 40 seconds. 
Since most options require multiple operations (commands to the inverter) 
to get all the data this could make it look like aurora is not doing 
anything. If in doubt run aurora in verbose mode (-b) to see what it is 
doing.

If running aurora every minute to collect data this could mean that a
previous running instance of aurora (when using a large value for the -R 
and/or -l option) hasn't completed executing when another instance of 
aurora starts running. To avoid this scenario use the -M option to give 
aurora a maximum amount time to run, specified in seconds. If aurora has 
not completed in the amount of time specified by the -M options value it 
will exit when it has exceeded the amount of time that was specified.

If having problems communicating with the inveter it is recommended that 
the -l option be tried first using values up to and including 10. If that 
does not improve the communication then try the -R option starting at 500 
(without using the -l option) and working up to a value of 2000. And then  
if still encountering problems use a combination of the -l option and the  
-R option. Noting that the amount of time that aurora will try to read 
each character from the inverter will be the sum of the times specified by
the -l and -R options.

Example: Using --read-wait=15 --read-timeout=3000 aurora will wait
         (15 * 1/10) + (3000 / 1000) =
             1.5     +      3.0      = 4.5 seconds to read each character 
of the response from the inverter. Each response from the inveter is 8
characters in length so reading one complete response could take up to 36
seconds in this example and reading some data from the inverter requires 
multiple responses.
